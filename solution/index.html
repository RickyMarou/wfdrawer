            My money's in
            <button class="inline-button" id="open-drawer">that office</button>,
            right? If she start giving me some bullshit about it ain't there,
            and we got to go someplace else and get it, I'm gonna shoot you in
            the head then and there. Then I'm gonna shoot that bitch in the
            kneecaps, find out where my goddamn money is. She gonna tell me too.
            Hey, look at me when I'm talking to you, motherfucker. You listen:
            we go in there, and that nigga Winston or anybody else is in there,
            you the first motherfucker to get shot. You understand?

            You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has
            a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for
            murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I
            don't know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that
            seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we
            took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the
            snow that killed the other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but
            it doesn't hold a candle to man.

            Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't
            make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass
            motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks.
            Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause
            I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?

            Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag
            clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little
            Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a
            mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No?
            Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you must think you're
            in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named
            Jeb.
